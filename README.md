# Work-Day-Scheduler

My read me consists of an HTML page, a JS page and an CSS page.

My HTML page contains some links to boostrap, fontawesome, google APIs and a script source to cloudfare along with linking the JS and CSS pages as well.

The HTML page covers the body with a container with a timeblock of multiple div classes.

The JS page covers the function of the click button anf the function of time blocks (curent time).

The JS page also includes the local storage for each time block.
